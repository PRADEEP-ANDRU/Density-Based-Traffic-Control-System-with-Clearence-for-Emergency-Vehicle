# Density-Based-Traffic-Control-System-with-Clearence-for-Emergency-Vehicle

# Objective 
<ul>
<li>To reduce traffic congestion caused due to fixed signal time irrespective of number of vehicles present. <br/>
<li>To establish communication between Emergency Vehicles and Traffic signal for faster access through the conjunction.
</ul>

# Problem Statement
Normally ,a conventional traffic light works on a fixed time concept allotted to each side of the junction which cannot be varied and junction timings allotted are fixed. In some cases , higher traffic density occurs at one side of the junction which demands longer green time as compared to standard allocated time.
In today’ s world, during rush hours, emergency vehicles get stuck in jams. Neither manual control by police officers nor using predefined timers has proved effective. Due to this, these emergency vehicles are not able to reach their destinations in time, resulting in a loss.

# Components Used
-> Arduino Mega <br/>
-> IR Sensors <br/>
-> MFRC522 RFID Reader and Tags <br/>
-> Cathode RGB Led <br/>
-> Breadboard <br/>
-> Jumper Wires <br/>

# Advantages
<ul>
  <li> Traffic congestion can be controlled automatically
  <li> Emergency vehicles need not wait for longer time at conjuctions
  <li> Reduces need for Man power
  <li> Reduces cost of Production and Maintainence
</ul>
 
# Conclusion and Future Work
There is exigent need of efficient traffic management system in our country, as India meets with 384 road accidents every day. To reduce this congestion and unwanted time delay in traffic an advanced system is designed here in this project. With field application of this
technology, the maddening chaos of traffic can be effectively channelized by distributing the time slots based on the merit of the vehicle load in certain lanes of multi junction crossing.<br/>
• Low range IR sensors may not be an answer for long range signalling system. We may
resort to ultrasound or radar techniques for big scale set-ups.<br/>
• Next is the influence of stray signals that may alter the reading of sensor receptors and lead
to conveying false information to the microcontroller.<br/>
• Periodic checking of the accuracy and precision is a must for efficacious operation of this
model prototype.
